    description: >-
      It's a good idea to add a backup web3 provider in case your main one goes down. For example, if your primary EL client is a local Geth, but you want to use Infura as a backup.
      Get your web3 backup from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon.infura.io)
